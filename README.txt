Site Interface:

When you first access the platform, you'll encounter the "Log in/Registration" screen. If you wish to register, simply follow the provided instructions.
For logging in, you will initially have the "Customer" role, allowing you only to view the "Task List." To add tasks or edit them, you need to request the "Admin" to change your role to "MANAGER."
The "Admin" is the first user created, with access to all features. Username: "Admin" Password: "12345."
A user with the "MANAGER" role can add tasks and edit the tasks they've created.

Database Setup Instructions:

Launch XAMPP and access the database management tool.
Create a new user named "tasktable":
Username: "tasktable"
Host: Any
Password: "tasktable"
Check the box to create a new database and grant all privileges.
Navigate to the "operations" tab and select the "collation" item.
Change the value to "utf8_general_ci" for proper character encoding.
These steps are essential for setting up the required database to work with the site.
